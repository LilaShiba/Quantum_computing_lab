# [What is Light?](https://youtu.be/7UuUOXfiz9Q?si=eZvPbhvttn-waPDz)

By the end of this lab, you will be able to explain the quantum properties of light using Dirac Notation.

## 🪄 Photons: The Tricksters of Light 🪄

Photons are the tiny particles that make up light, but they don't always play by the rules we expect! 🌟🔍 Unlike arrows that fly straight and true, photons can be in multiple places at once, interfere with themselves, and even communicate faster than the speed of light! 🚀✨ Let's explore some of these magical behaviors through the lens of quantum computing.

## 🔍 Understanding Vectors 🔍

Before we dive deeper into our quantum adventure, let's take a moment to understand vectors, which are fundamental to quantum computing.

### What is a Vector?
A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude (size) and direction. Think of it as an arrow: the length of the arrow represents the magnitude, and the way it points represents the direction.

### How Do We Use Vectors in Quantum Computing?
In quantum computing, vectors help us represent quantum states. For example, a single qubit (the basic unit of quantum information) can be represented as a vector in a two-dimensional space. This vector tells us the probabilities of the qubit being in different states.

### Vectors in Bra-Ket Notation
- The state \( |0\rangle \) can be represented as a vector: \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \)
- The state \( |1\rangle \) can be represented as a vector: \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

## 🧪 Experiment: Polarized Light and Quantum States 🧪

Now, let's tie this understanding of vectors into our experiment. We'll be passing light through three layers of polarized film to demonstrate quantum properties.

### What Are Polarized Films?
Polarized films are materials that only allow light waves vibrating in a certain direction to pass through. When light passes through these films, its direction (or polarization state) changes, much like how vectors can change direction.

### Our Experiment Setup

Task: Create a program to measure light in lux using Python & the Your RPi.


1. **Layer 1:** The first layer of polarized film will align the photons in a specific direction.

2. **Layer 2:** The second layer, oriented at a different angle, will alter the photons' directions further.

3. **Layer 3:** The third layer will demonstrate how the final direction of the photons is influenced by the previous two layers.

### Connecting to Vectors
Think of the polarization of light as a vector. Each layer of polarized film changes the direction of this vector. By observing the changes in light intensity and direction after each layer, we can visualize how vectors (quantum states) are manipulated in quantum computing.

### Observing Quantum Behavior
As we pass light through these three layers, we'll notice some surprising results:
- Light that is completely blocked by the first two layers might pass through when a third layer is added at a specific angle.
- This behavior is similar to how qubits can exist in superposition and change states in ways that classical particles cannot.
